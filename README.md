# VkPlayground
My personal library for Vulkan projects

Examples of projects that use this library:
- [GPU_SVOEngine](https://github.com/GMunozRodr/GPU_SVOEngine)
- [ZPRepass-Vulkan](https://github.com/GMunozRodr/ZPrepass-Vulkan)
- [Vulkan-GFlow](https://github.com/GMunozRodr/Vulkan-GFlow)

# Update 2025
This library has helped me learn Vulkan so much over the years, and I love for that. But it has some glaring issues that past me made. While it makes programming in vulkan slightly less verbose, it introduces a lot of internal complexity with constant linear searches, polymorphism and extra handling. Therefore, it is time to leave this library behind. Dynamic rendering, modern sync systems and bindless descriptors have made Vulkan much more usable to the point where I don't really need an abstraction library. VkPlayground2 will be a set of tools to work alongside Vulkan, not on top of it.

This repository is archived as I will no longer be using it.
